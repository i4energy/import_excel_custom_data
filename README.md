# Excel Template Project

This project demonstrates basic functionality to download an Excel template, upload an Excel file, and parse data from the rows. It uses Node.js on the server side to handle Excel file operations and a React application with Vite on the client side for the user interface.

## Project Structure

- `/server` - Contains the Node.js server code.
- `/client` - Contains the React frontend code.

## Getting Started

### Server Setup

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

### Client Setup

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will launch the React application on `http://localhost:5173`.
